# JWT Authentication Application

This project is a simple authentication system built using Spring Boot, where users can authenticate using a username and password. Once authenticated, a JSON Web Token (JWT) is generated and returned in the response, allowing the user to make authenticated requests. The JWT is signed to ensure data integrity.

## Technologies Used

- **Java** (JDK 8+)
- **Spring Boot**
  - Spring Web
  - Spring Security
- **JWT** (JSON Web Token)
- **Maven** (for dependency management)

## Authentication Flow

1. **User Input:** A user sends a POST request to the `/authenticate` endpoint, including their username and password in the request body.
2. **Hardcoded User Validation:** The application validates the user's credentials against hardcoded values.
3. **JWT Generation:** If the credentials are correct, a JWT is generated and returned as a response.
4. **Token Usage:** The JWT can then be used by the client for authenticating subsequent requests.

## Project Structure

Here’s a breakdown of the key directories and files in the project:

```bash
├── src/
│   ├── main/
│   │   ├── java/
│   │   │   ├── com.example.jwt/ 
│   │   │   │   ├── JwtAuthenticationController.java  # Handles the /authenticate POST request
│   │   │   │   ├── JwtTokenUtil.java                 # Utility class to generate and validate JWT tokens
│   │   │   │   ├── JwtRequest.java                   # Request DTO for username and password
│   │   │   │   ├── JwtResponse.java                  # Response DTO for JWT token

├── pom.xml                                            # Maven configuration
```

### Key Files:

1. **JwtAuthenticationController.java**: Defines the `/authenticate` endpoint and processes the authentication requests.
2. **JwtTokenUtil.java**: Contains utility methods for generating, parsing, and validating JWT tokens.
3. **SecurityConfig.java**: Configures Spring Security to manage authentication and authorization.

## Running the Application

### Prerequisites

- **Java 8+** should be installed on your machine.
- **Maven** should be installed to manage dependencies.

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository/jwt-authentication-app.git
   cd jwt-authentication-app
   ```

2. Build and run the application:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

The application will start running on `http://localhost:8080`.

## API Endpoint

- **POST /authenticate**

  **Description**: This endpoint takes a username and password, validates them, and returns a JWT token.

  **Request:**
  ```json
  POST /authenticate
  Content-Type: application/json
  {
    "username": "user",
    "password": "password123"
  }
  ```

  **Response:**
  ```json
  {
    "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5..."
  }
  ```

### Example of Use:

To authenticate, make a `POST` request to `/authenticate` and use the provided JWT token in the `Authorization` header for subsequent requests.

## Security Considerations

- **Hardcoded Credentials**: This application currently uses hardcoded credentials for simplicity. In a production environment, use a secure database and hashed passwords.
- **JWT Expiration**: The JWT token should have an expiration time set. In this implementation, you can configure it in `JwtTokenUtil.java`.
- **HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production to protect credentials during authentication.
